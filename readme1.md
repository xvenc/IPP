## Task

The main goal was to create a script to check if the given IPPcode22 is lexically and syntactically correct. 
And to print the XML representation of this code to STDOUT.

## Solution

The solution for the 1. task is split into 3 scripts (`parse.php, analyzer.php and generator.php`) and
their functionality will be described later on. To write the correct representation of the code `XMLWriter` 
is used. If the argument `--help` is set the script will print help and exit.

### parse.php
This is the main srcipt. 

### analyzer.php

### generator.php
